        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>Argentina's neighboring countries claim to be the inventors of this recipe and you may have even heard of it in Mexico named as "Cajeta". Honestly, I don't know who made it but if you do, do me a favour and go tell that man that he is a genius. This is a long recipe, tho. You better have some time in your hands if you think you are deserving of this dream made true.</em></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Milk.</li>
            <li>Sugar.</li>
            <li>Baking Soda.</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up all the ingredients in a cooking pot while mixing constantly with a wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Once the sugar gets dissolved, lower the fire a bit and keep mixing for 2 hours (told you). If the thing starts to boil, lower the fire and turn it up again once it cools down.</li>
            <li>Once it gets kind of thick, keep mixing constatly so it doesn't get lumpy.</li>
            <li>When you see that it gets a consistency similar to a custard, turn off the heat. Keep mixing until it cools down.</li>
            <li>Once it's cool, save it in jar and keep it in the refrigerator .</li>
        </ol>
